# Matrix-C

Implementation of the matrix.h library

Matrix operations

All operations (except matrix comparison) should return the resulting code:

0 - OK
1 - Error, incorrect matrix
2 - Calculation error (mismatched matrix sizes; matrix for which calculations cannot be performed, etc.)

Creating matrices (create_matrix)

Cleaning of matrices (remove_matrix)

Matrix comparison (eq_matrix)

Adding (sum_matrix) and subtracting matrices (sub_matrix)

Matrix multiplication by scalar (mult_number)

Multiplication of two matrices (mult_matrix)

Matrix transpose (transpose)

Minor of matrix and matrix of algebraic complements (calc_complements)

Matrix determinant

Inverse of the matrix (inverse_matrix)
